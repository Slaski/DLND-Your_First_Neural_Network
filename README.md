# Project 1 - Your first neural network

This is the first project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course from Udacity.
In this project we built a neural network in python using only numpy and pandas.

## Getting started

You'll need anaconda installed to run the following code to import the environment and start the project.

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
activate project_first_neural_network
jupyter notebook
```
